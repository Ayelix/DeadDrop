DeadDrop
========

DeadDrop takes the concept of a "dead drop" ([Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_drop)) online.  Stick an NFC tag in your drop location, scan the tag, and upload your data.  When someone wants to pick up your drop, they'll need to scan the same NFC tag in the same location.  If the tag is scanned in the wrong place, the data won't be delivered.
